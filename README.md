```lrc
[00:20.05] Moonlight passes you
[00:22.90] Fades it all from view
[00:25.47] All that midnight blue
[00:27.58] Becomes a memory of you
[00:39.08] 
[00:30.49] Your shadow on the wall
[00:32.80] A person I can't recall
[00:35.13] The masks you wear become your face
[00:37.87] And your memories erase
[00:49.37] 
[00:40.46] I seen it your face—tranquillity
[00:41.77] Pull'n it out like some formality
[00:43.01] I don't wanna feel your sympathy
[00:44.34] I'm already feeling sickly
[00:57.34] 
[00:45.72] Things go dark, it's hard to breathe
[00:47.07] Fall'n like those autumn leaves
[00:48.01] I can barely stand to see
[00:49.45] Whatever is left of me
[01:00.45] 
[00:50.49] The moon is fading
[00:52.84] Into twilight skies
[00:55.20] Oh god, please answer me
[00:57.86] Do I have more time?
[01:07.86] 
[00:59.76] And in this moonlight daydream
[01:02.91] Where I can't find light
[01:04.79] Your shadow beckons me
[01:07.47] (Won't you let me?)
[01:16.97] 
[01:10.89] Inside, all this pain I hide
[01:14.72] I couldn't feel
[01:17.41] Why can't I
[01:18.83] Believe my lie?
